Breed procedurally generated plants based on their DNA

Great toy for boring meetings :)

## Usage

* Open in browser
* Click on breed button (ðŸ’•) of one individual and then on breed button (ðŸ’•) of another
* Potentially wait a few seconds
* You should now have a new generation based on those two individuals
* Repeat and have fun

## Known Problems / Improvement opportunities

* Depending on the DNAs of the population it might take a little while to render. I didn't spend time to optimize it much sorry.
* Depending on the DNA some individuals might become a little too big to fully fit onto the screen or overlap each other.
* Some aspects could be further tied to the underlying DNA model to allow for more variety. See TODOs.
* I hacked this together as a proof of concept and deliberately decided to have it all in one file.

## Collaboration

* Feel free to open issues to bounce ideas
* Make PRs if you improved something
* Let me know if you based your work on this. Would love to see. Credits optional but appreciated.
